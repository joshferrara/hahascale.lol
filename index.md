### Introduction

Communicating through text is hard. Apparently, reacting to the stupid things your hilarious friends say is also difficult, because you've invented "words" like `haha`, `lol`, `rofl`, and `lmao` to show when something is funny to you.

On top of the ridiculous words you've invented, it's _still_ impossible to tell when one thing is funnier than another. Is `hahaha` more or less funny than `lol`? Is `ðŸ˜‚` stronger than `ðŸ’€`? More importantly, how many skull emojis does it take before we collectively agree you're being dramatic? Animals.

### Usage

This system is designed to give you and your chronically online friends a uniform way to communicate your reaction to funny stuff. It's pretty simple, but you should probably pay attention.

There are only three rules:

- Humor is measured from `ha1` to `ha10`.
- A `ha1` may also be expressed as a `ha`.
- Don't use `lol` ever again.

### Examples

> `ha2` = Friend sends you a TikTok that's been on your FYP for weeks.

> `ha9` = That one friend who always finds unhinged Twitter/X threads before they blow up.

> `ha5` = Coworker shares a millennial pause video in the group chat.

> `ha1` = Someone replies with just "this" to your message.

> `ha7` = Friend sends perfectly timed SpongeBob meme in response to your life crisis.

> `ha3` = Dad discovers a meme format from 2020 and thinks he's hilarious.

> `ha8` = That friend who quotes Vine/TikTok audio at the perfect moment IRL.

> `ha4` = Someone sends a Minion meme unironically.

### Summary

At the end of the day, your friends probably aren't as funny as their algorithm-curated content makes them seem, but at least now we can all be on the same page with our reactions to humor. Please stop `lol`ing. We're begging you.
